    "Advances in rapid, low cost analysis of soil samples using infrared spectroscopy, georeferencing of soil samples, and greater availability of earth remote sensing data provide new opportunities for predicting soil functional properties at unsampled locations. Soil functional properties are those properties related to a soilâ€™s capacity to support essential ecosystem services such as primary productivity, nutrient and water retention, and resistance to soil erosion."

    "Diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy has shown potential in numerous studies to provide a highly repeatable, rapid and low cost measurement of many soil functional properties. The amount of light absorbed by a soil sample is measured, with minimal sample preparation, at hundreds of specific wavebands across a range of wavelengths to provide an infrared spectrum. The measurement can be typically performed in about 30 seconds, in contrast to conventional reference tests, which are slow and expensive and use chemicals."
